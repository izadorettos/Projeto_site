            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The history of monkeys can be divided into their biological evolution and cultural examples, such as the famous experiment of the five monkeys and legends. Evolution traces the emergence of primates from small mammals that lived in trees millions of years ago. The experiment of the five monkeys demonstrates how behavior can be conditioned and passed on, even if the original reason is no longer known, and is often used as an allegory for organizational culture.</p>

            <h2>Races</h2>
            <p>There are many species of monkeys, but some of the best known are marmosets, golden lion tamarins, howler monkeys, capuchin monkeys, uacaris, and muriquis. Monkeys are classified into different families and genera, with varieties ranging from the smallest in the world to the largest primates, such as gorillas and orangutans, which are not technically monkeys, but rather hominids.</p>
